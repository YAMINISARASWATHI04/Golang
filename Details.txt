Engine in ginframeworks in central hub for webserver
FUNCTIONS:
    ->HTTP routing: Handles incoming requests
    ->It maintains a middleware functions for logging,authentication,etc
    ->It has direct function to start http server

Using context.JSON we can send the response without using any return function

Http.StatusOK returns the status numbers
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status
Above link contains all the status codes

API Endpoints are set of protocols which defines how a client can request data to server 
Endpoints are accessed using HTTP methods like PUT,POST,GET.These methodsn indicate what actions the client is going to take

ShouldBindBodyWithJSON(&blog) -> gin will take a look at incoming request and save in that variable
Clients need to data in the given format

This error is ssl error
For this one we need to put http instead of https

RESTAPI rule -> What ever transaction or request we pass It should be Idempotent

sql.Open()

->Open opens a database specified by its database driver name and a driver-specific data source name, usually consisting of at least a database name and connection information.

->Most users will open a database via a driver-specific connection helper function that returns a [*DB]. No database drivers are included in the Go standard library. See https://golang.org/s/sqldrivers for a list of third-party drivers.

->Open may just validate its arguments without creating a connection to the database. To verify that the data source name is valid, call [DB.Ping].

->The returned [DB] is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines and maintains its own pool of idle connections. Thus, the Open function should be called just once. It is rarely necessary to close a [DB].
