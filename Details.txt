Engine in ginframeworks in central hub for webserver
FUNCTIONS:
    ->HTTP routing: Handles incoming requests
    ->It maintains a middleware functions for logging,authentication,etc
    ->It has direct function to start http server

Using context.JSON we can send the response without using any return function

Http.StatusOK returns the status numbers
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status
Above link contains all the status codes

API Endpoints are set of protocols which defines how a client can request data to server 
Endpoints are accessed using HTTP methods like PUT,POST,GET.These methodsn indicate what actions the client is going to take

ShouldBindBodyWithJSON(&blog) -> gin will take a look at incoming request and save in that variable
Clients need to data in the given format

ShouldBindJSON -> parse the JSON data from an HTTP request body and bind it to a Go struct or object, validating the data based on struct tags in the process
	// we need to pass a pointer to the blog to modify data in the blog variable

In the Gin web framework, the c.ShouldBindJSON() function is used to parse an incoming HTTP request body 
that contains JSON data and bind it to a Go struct or map,


'''write EPROTO 1288491840640:error:100000f7:SSL routines:OPENSSL_internal:WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER:../../third_party/boringssl/src/ssl/tls_record.cc:127:'''
This error is ssl error
For this one we need to put http instead of https

Marshal 

RESTAPI rule -> What ever transaction or request we pass It should be Idempotent

sql.Open()

->Open opens a database specified by its database driver name and a driver-specific data source name, usually consisting of at least a database name and connection information.

->Most users will open a database via a driver-specific connection helper function that returns a [*DB]. No database drivers are included in the Go standard library. See https://golang.org/s/sqldrivers for a list of third-party drivers.

->Open may just validate its arguments without creating a connection to the database. To verify that the data source name is valid, call [DB.Ping].

->The returned [DB] is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines and maintains its own pool of idle connections. Thus, the Open function should be called just once. It is rarely necessary to close a [DB].

Exec () -> It is used to run sql queries and it returns an integer value used for dml statements such as insert, update and delete

Query() -> It is used to retrive data from database 

Context.Background() ->When a new request arrives at a server, context.Background() can be used to create the initial, top-level context from which all request-specific contexts (with timeouts, cancellation, or values) are derived.
 
Prepare()- To prepare the SQL statement for execution. It returns a prepared statement that can be executed multiple times with different parameters.
 when we use prepare it stores in memory and we can execute it multiple times with different parameters which will improve the performance of our application by reducing the time taken to parse and compile the SQL statement for each execution.

// gin.H is a shortcut for map[string]interface{} which is a map with string keys and values

gin.context -//context parameter will be set by gin and will be pointer to gin
	// Reach out to a database
	// Write in a file
	// Make an API call to another service

/ gin helps us to recover from panics and return a 500 Internal Server Error response to the client instead of crashing the server
	DB.SetMaxOpenConns(10) // To confgure connection pooling for better performance and resource management
	// Connection pooling is a performance optimization technique that maintains a cache of active database connections, allowing them to be reused for multiple requests rather than creating a new connection each time
	// when we open this it controls how many connections can be open at a time to the database. By default, it is set to 0 which means unlimited connections. We can set it to a specific number to limit the number of connections that can be open at a time.
